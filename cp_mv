cp    #copy origin destination

sudo cp -rv <fromfile> <tofile>

copies a file from one location to another

–v  verbose: shows the progress of multiple copied files
–p  preserve: keeps the same attributes, like creation date and file permissions
–f  force: force the copy by deleting an existing file first
–i  interactive: prompts for confirmation, highly advised
–R recursive: copies all files and subfolders in a directory
–u update: copy only if source is newer than destination

mv    #old/location/name new/location/name

*    #refers to any number of characters, * = all files, *files = all files begining with "files"
?    #refers to any character but only a single instance, used on its own would only be files with a single character name, files? = would have exactly 6 characters

rm file*    # removes all files that begin with "file" no matter how many characters follow
rm file?    # removes all files that begin with "file" and have one charater after in the name.  e.g. fileA would be deleted but file456 would not be.
mv ../file* .    # moves all file* from directory above to current directory
