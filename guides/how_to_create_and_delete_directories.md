# How to create and delete directories

## Create

- `mkdir NewDirName` - simple create
- `mkdir -p dir1/dir2` - make directory and parent directory
- `mkdir --parents dir1/dir2` - long form

## Delete

- `rm -rf dir1` - recursively delete, delete it any everything in it, dir doesn't have to be empty like usual
